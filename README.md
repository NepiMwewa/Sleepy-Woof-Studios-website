# P3_Harmon_Alexander
This is the final project for my DMA C119 Advance Web Development class at Cerro Coso Community College. This course taugt more indepth on how to code properly in HTML5 and CSS3 and responsive design for mobile and smaller screens. I made the website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The website can be seen here: https://nepimwewa.github.io/P3_Harmon_Alexander/
This reposity comes from a previous repository that I was working on. The reason they are split apart is because P3 was the final assignment and P2 was the midterm assignment. The previous repository can be viewed here: https://github.com/NepiMwewa/P2_Harmon_Alexander
